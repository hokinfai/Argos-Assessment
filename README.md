# Argos-Assessment
First version - extract data and compare price

This project is to extract the top 10 hottest products form HUKD.com and compare the price to the similar products on Walmart.  If users wanna buy the products, they can click either the product image or purchase link.  Product description will be shown once the mouse pointer is pointing to the product image.  There are also links to the different merchants websites.  The temperature of the product on HUKD and the similar product found on Walmart are also provided.

This project is mainly using Java programming language.  The front-end interface is JSP which combines html and Java.  The components are shown below:
IDE - Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers.
Server - Tomcat.
Webpage - HTML and CSS.
Java library - Java Json.

Since the project has to gain access to both HUKD and Walmart website's API, therefore the response time will be a bit slow, it may take up to 20 seconds.

Five java classes and five JSP pages that form the basis of this system.  Four Java external libraries, one XML and one CSS file.

5 Java classes are under Java Resources.
5 JSP pages are under WebContent folder.
1 xml is under WEB-INF folder.
4 Java libraries are located in WebContent/WEB-INF/lib/.
CSS and image folders are also placed under WebContent folder.

An image called "Configuration" is provided to show how to put all of these files.

Screemshots of outcomes are also provided inside the "Results" folder.
